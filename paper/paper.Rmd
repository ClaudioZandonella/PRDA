# Summary

*Design Analysis* was introduced by @gelmanPowerCalculationsAssessing2014 as an extension of Power Analysis. Traditional power analysis has a narrow focus on statistical significance. Design analysis, instead, evaluates together with power levels also other inferential risks (i.e., Type M error and Type S error), to assess estimates uncertainty under hypothetical replications of a study.

Given a hypothetical value of effect size and study characteristics (i.e., sample size, statistical test directionality, significance level),
*Type M error* (Magnitude, also known as Exaggeration Ratio) indicates the factor by which a statistically significant effect is on average exaggerated. *Type S error* (Sign), instead, indicates the probability of finding a statistically significant result in the opposite direction to the hypothetical effect.

Although Type M error and Type S error depend directly on power level, they underline valuable information regarding estimates uncertainty that would otherwise be overlooked. This enhances researchers awareness about the inferential risks related to their studies and helps them in the interpretation of their results. However, design analysis is rarely applied in real research settings also for the lack of dedicated software.

To know more about design analysis consider @gelmanPowerCalculationsAssessing2014 and @luNoteTypeErrors2018. While, for an introduction to design analysis with examples in psychology see @altoeEnhancingStatisticalInference2020 and  @bertoldoDesigningStudiesEvaluating2020.


# Statement of need 

`PRDA` is an R package for performing prospective or retrospective design analysis to evaluate inferential risks (i.e., power, Type M error, and Type S error) in a study considering Pearson's correlation between two variables or mean comparisons (one-sample, paired, two-sample, and Welch's *t*-test).

*Prospective Design Analysis* is performed in the planning stage of the study to define the required sample size to obtain a given level of power. *Retrospective Design Analysis*, instead, is performed when the data have already been collected to evaluate the inferential risks associated with the study.

Another recent R package, `retrodesign` [@timmRetrodesignToolsType2019], allows conducting retrospective design analysis considering estimate of the true effect size and standard error of the estimate. Compared to this latter, `PRDA` package offers
