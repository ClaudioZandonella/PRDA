## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed the explicit C++11 specification from the Makevars file as requested, to ensure forward compatibility with RcppArmadillo and to use R's modern default C++ standard.


## Test environments

* Mac OS X 15.6 (local machine):
  - release R 4.5.1
* win-builder:
  - release R 4.5.
  - devel R 4.1.0 (2020-11-24 r79490)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs
